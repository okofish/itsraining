## Check it out [here](https://okofish.github.io/itsraining)!

itsraining broadens the scope of [The Weather Girls'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weather_Girls) [famous song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Raining_Men) to include other words ending with the "-en" sound.

## TODO
- Debug sound playback (sometimes the loop will break and it just starts repeating the TTS utterance)
- Add more rhymes! See rhymes.js.
